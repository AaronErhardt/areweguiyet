# Readme

## What is this?

Right now this is a collection of our thoughts, notes, and ideas from the 
unofficial Rust Discord on the various approaches to making interactive 
graphical user interfaces in the Rust programming language. Inspired by
[arewegameyet](http://arewegameyet.com), 
[arewewebyet](http://www.arewewebyet.org), and others.

## Existing Frameworks

Here we shall compile a list of functioning libraries that can be used for UI.
TODO.

 * ?

## Bindings to existing Frameworks

We should probably collect a list of existing bindings for completeness sake.

## Personal Notes

We are also collecting links to various community members's notes on GUI. 
See [personal notes](personal_notes.md). Please make a PR if you are interested
in adding yours.

## Contributing

It would be nice if we could generate this Readme from meta data and add 
entries via CLI.

If someone wants to, they could also build this out into a sister website to
[arewewebyet](http://arewegameyet.org), 
[arewegameyet](http://arewegameyet.com), etc.
